## How this project was created

This project was created using this command:

```sh
npm create vite@latest food-starter -- --template react
```

and then following all of the steps below.

## Install React Boostrap, Vitest, and React Testing Library

```sh
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui eslint-plugin-vitest
npm install -D jsdom @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react eslint-plugin-jest-dom eslint-plugin-testing-library
npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap
```

## Add Bootstrap

Add this line to _src/main.jsx_:

```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
```

## Update port to 3000

To match the expectation of the server, and avoid CORS errors, add this to the property / value to the `defineConfig` argument in _vite.config.js_:

```js
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    // exit if port 3000 is in use (to avoid CORS errors; server expects port 3000)
    strict: true,
  },
```

## Add `start` script to package.json

In order to match the legacy course videos (which were filmed with create-react-app), add this to the _package.json_ `scripts` array:

```json
    "start": "vite",
```

## Install future dependencies

For folks using this as a starter for adding React code, run these installs:

```sh
npm install -D @testing-library/user-event msw
npm install axios
```

## Add test script to package.json `test` object

```json
  "test": "vitest"
```

## Add a test setup file

To make [jest-dom matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers) available in all test files:

1. create new file _src/setupTests.js_
1. add these contents:

```js
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
```

## Add Vitest and Testing Library plugins to ESLint

In _.eslintrc.cjs_:

1. Add these to to the `extends` array:

```js
   'plugin:testing-library/react',
   'plugin:vitest/recommended',
   'plugin:jest-dom/recommended',
```

1. This step avoids linting errors when using the `test` and `expect` Vitest globals without importing them first.

At the top, require the Vitest plugin:

```js
const vitest = require("eslint-plugin-vitest");
```

Then Add this property / value to the top-level `module.exports` object:

```js
    globals: {
      ...vitest.environments.env.globals,
    },
```

## Update a few ESLint rules

Add these to the `rules` object in _.eslintrc.cjs_:

```js
    "no-unused-vars": "warn", // warning, not error
    "vitest/expect-expect": "off", // eliminate distracting red squiggles while writing tests
    "react/prop-types": "off", // turn off props validation
```

## Update vite configuration for tests

Update _vite.config.js_ based on the [Vitest Testing Library example](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/blob/main/examples/react-testing-lib/vite.config.ts). Add this property / value to the `defineConfig` argument:

```js
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: "jsdom",
    // this points to the setup file created earlier
    setupFiles: "./src/setup.js",
    // you might want to disable the `css: true` line, since we don't have
    // tests that rely on CSS -- and parsing CSS is slow.
    // I'm leaving it in here becasue often people want to parse CSS in tests.
    css: true,
  },
```

## Command to run tests in watch mode

```sh
npm test
```
